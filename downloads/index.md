To save space, many of our files are distributed as compressed XZ format files. Windows users can download [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to uncompress these files, while macOS users can use [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/). R should also be able to read XZ files natively without decompressing the file first.
