## Citing

The data presented on this website were published as a part of:

<p markdown="0">
Daniel L. Rabosky*, Jonathan Chang*, Pascal O. Title*, Peter F. Cowman, Lauren Sallan, Matt Friedman, Kristin Kaschner, Cristina Garilao, Thomas J. Near, Marta Coll, Michael E. Alfaro* (2018).  An inverse latitudinal gradient in speciation rate for marine fishes. <em>Nature</em> doi:<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0273-1">10.1038/s41586-018-0273-1</a></p>

Please cite this publication if you use any phylogenetic products derived from this website, including taxonomic resources and fossil calibration constraints. We have also [released a set of enhanced ATA trees]({% link downloads/index.md %}); the details on how these ATA distributions differ are detailed in [Rabosky et al. 2018 update]({% link rabosky-et-al-2018-update.md %}). [The original set of ATA phylogenies are available via Dryad](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.fc71cp4).

We also offer an R package that provides programmatic access to the data products on this website, [`fishtree`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fishtree). If you use the R package, the citation for the R package and website API is:

The manuscript describing the taxonomic addition algorithm (TACT) for the full tree distributions is currently in preparation.

The manuscript detailing our Phylogentic Fish Classification is currently in preparation.

## Future updates

We are also interested in fixing any phylogenetic and taxonomic errors in a future revision of the Fish Tree of Life, especially rogue taxa that break the monophyly of well-studied lineages. Known issues include:

* Total group *Hippocampus* age should be 11 Ma
* Relationships within Cichlidae are not quite correct
* *Chlorurus gibbus* has rogue behavior
* *Takifugu fasciatus* is actually *T. obscurus*

If you identify any issues, [please fill out this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyE_NT5WiQA3Er62ZJzIHrRnOP0ASzPYrh294Nr5pOm4kTDg/viewform?usp=sf_link) so we can collate all fixes for a future revision. Thanks!
